# Cellular Network Simulator (CNS)
Main.py contains the code for a powerful cellular network simulator with various configurable parameters and simualtion environments. 

The CNS is capable of simulating the following exisiting scheduling modes:

1. Round Robin 
2. Fractional Frequency Reuse

As well as some novel modes:

1. Adaptive Fractional Frequency Reuse
2. Approach 1.1
3. Approach 1.2


## Installation
To begin using the simulator, clone the project in the desired directory. Uncomment the desired scheduling mode from line 663 to 667. Run the file in a Python3 interpreter.
